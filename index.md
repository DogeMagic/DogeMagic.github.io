# Introduction

Hello, My name is Yaitza Aguilar. I am currently a student California State University, Fullerton, majoring in Electrical Engineering. 

## Programming Projects

### CPSC 120
- Lab 4

    Lab 4, Part 2, was one of my favorite labs because it introduced me to writing functions in a way that felt clear and easy to understand. Even though the program was simple, creating a guessing game helped me see how small pieces of code can work together to build something fun. I liked this lab because it helped me realize that even basic programs can teach important skills in programming that I haven’t learned before.

- Lab 5

    Lab 5, Part 1, was meaningful to me because it was the only lab I completed entirely on my own. Working through it helped me realize how much there is to learn, and how even basic lines of code can take you a long way when you understand how they work. Although Part 2 was challenging, the struggle taught me how valuable logic functions are in coding, and it’s an experience I will remember and continue to learn from.

- Lab 8

    Lab 8, Part 2, was another one of my favorites this semester because it focused on creating patterns, which I found fun and visually interesting. This lab taught me the importance of using meaningful names for values, since unclear names can make the code confusing and harder to follow. Even though it took some effort to keep everything organized, seeing the final patterns appear at the end made the whole process enjoyable.
